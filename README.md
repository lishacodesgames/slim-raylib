<h3><b>About Raylib</b></h3>

**raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.**

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework and it's especially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.

*NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no debug button... just coding in the most pure spartan-programmers way.*

*Lisha here. I love this GIF. My neurodivergent brain finds it extremely satisfying and hypnotizing :p*

## This Minimal, Slimmed, CMake-only fork
⚠️This repository is meant to be used only as a sub-module dependency for games. <br>
⚠️It is not intended to be built standalone and does not include examples. <br>
<br>
**What I removed:**
* IDE templates
* Alternate build systems
* examples/
* projects/
* tools/
* ..etc (I don't remember)
<br>

*Original repo:* [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
<br>

basic example
--------------
This is a basic raylib example, it creates a window and draws the text `"Congrats! You created your first window!"` in the middle of the screen. Check this example [running live on web here](https://www.raylib.com/examples/core/loader.html?name=core_basic_window).
```c
#include "raylib.h"

int main(void)
{
    InitWindow(800, 450, "raylib [core] example - basic window");

    while (!WindowShouldClose())
    {
        BeginDrawing();
            ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);
            DrawText("Congrats! You created your first window!", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY);
        EndDrawing();
    }

    CloseWindow();

    return 0;
}
```
## Usage (CMake Submodule)
1. Add this repository in your game's as a submodule: <br>
  `git submodule add https://github.com/lishacodesgames/slim-raylib.git raylib`
2. Add it in your project's CMakeLists.txt:
  ```cmake
  add_subdirectory(raylib)
  
  # eg. if your main.c or main.cpp is in src/ and your executable's name is "YourProjectName"
  add_executable(YourProjectName src/main.cpp) 
  target_link_libraries(YourProjectName PRIVATE raylib)
  ```
